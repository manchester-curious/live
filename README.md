# Manchester Curious


Built with [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/). 

## Notes

- Excuse the crap comments! I always forgot to commit as I go along so end up doning a mass commit at the end.

- I've put all the common elements into the 'partials' directory for easy maintenance.

- I haven't optimised the js/css, though I have concatenated the required Foundation js files into js/core.js.

- I'm not convinced that the layout for 'Programme' and 'Buildings & Tours' works on mobile - what do you think?

- We also need to decide what elements to leave out on mobiles.

- I may rework the partners page because the logos get quite small on mobile screens.
